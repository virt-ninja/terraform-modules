This module can be used to bootstrap a VCSA install prior to using the Terraform vSphere provider. Use the outputs as the variables for setting up the provider to create a soft dependancy or use depends on to ensure it is deployed first.

Notes:

  - Ensure you use the correct target specification (ESX or vCenter). Sensible defaults have been choosen to reduce the number of manadatory variables required.
  - Changing the FQDN of the vCenter will trigger a redeployment

This version is for vCenter 6.7, and has only been tested with 6.7 U2 so far. Feel free comment with other working versions or to submit a pull request to extend the version coverage.
